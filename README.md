# HackerNews-Terminal

HackerNews (HN) is blocked in China.
However, it's strange for the following two things:

1. HN is for technology information, and not politically sensitive
2. proxy is not effcetive here (don't know why)

Fortunately, a little crawler 🐛 is enough to get it back.

## Usage

```python
python3 hacker_news [numbers=10]
```

An example and its output:

```bash
./hacker_news.py 5
